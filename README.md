Haworthia: a minimalist, text oriented theme for Hugo
=====================================================

**Example:** https://strelnikov.xyz/

This repository contains a theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static website generator.

I designed this theme from scratch without a single reuse of third-party code. However some design solutions are significantly inspired by [cactus theme](https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus).

Flexibility and coverage of a large number of different use cases was not my goal when creating haworthia. This theme is designed to be used on one specific site.
